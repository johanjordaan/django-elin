2. The side detects that the user has not been authenticated yet.
3. The user is prompted to provide an email and pass a CAPTCHA.
4. django-elin sends the user an email with a URL containg the current valid token for the user.
5. The user clicks on the link and is allowd to interact with the site as an authenticated user.
