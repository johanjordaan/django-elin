django-elin [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]
=============

PLEASE CHECk BACK SOON THIS SITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE CODE IS BEING DIVORCED FROM THE ORIGINAL PROJECT FOR WHICH IT WAS DEVELOPED.

To see the current progress have a look on Trello : [https://trello.com/board/django-elin/4f4545a50b4f0def04c33b73]

This is a django application that allows for password-less login via email. 

The process works as follows: 
-----------------------------
1. A user browses to a django-elin protected site. 
2. The site detects that the user has not been authenticated yet.
3. The user is prompted to provide an email and pass a CAPTCHA.
4. django-elin sends the user an email with a URL containg the current valid token for the user.
5. The user clicks on the link and is allowd to interact with the site as an authenticated user.
